- Created a "Hello World" program in C++ per the lesson laid out in : https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/writing-your-first-program/

- Used command line compilation of the program using "g++" compiler like so : g++ -o HelloWorld HelloWorld.cpp

the above is the general syntax of producing object files using g++ compilation but I decided to put all object files into separate directory hence use the following command : 

g++ -o Learn\ C-Plus-Plus\ Tutorials\ Object\ Files/P-1\ -\ Hello\ World P-1\ -\ Hello\ World.cpp

- Post compilation executed the program using the following commands :

a) cd Learn\ C-Plus-Plus\ Tutorials\ Object\ Files/

b) ./P-1\ -\ Hello\ World
