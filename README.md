The problem is an implementation problem that involves checking if an integer that is input from standard input is an even integer or not. Only even numbers with the exception of "2" can be split into two parts x and y that are even themselves. In case of the number 2 the only possible split is "1+1" which are both odd.

2) https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/71/A [EASY]

The problem is an implementation problem that involves the following components -:

a) Reading the standard input for the number of strings.

b) Reading the "n" input strings using "getline".

c) Calculating the length of the input strings and checking the condition if the length of any of those strings is greater than 10 strictly.

d) Output the first character, the number "length - 2" and the last character if the word is a way too long word to the standard output.
